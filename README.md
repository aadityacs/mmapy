# mmapy
An opensource python implementation of the Method of moving asymptotes (MMA) forked from https://github.com/UW-ERSL/AuTO

The MMA algorithm is used largely in the topology optimization field. Here we have a python implementation of the algorithm. To understand the API, kindly see mma_test.py. 

If you use this code in your paper, kindly cite the original MMA paper and the AuTO paper.
